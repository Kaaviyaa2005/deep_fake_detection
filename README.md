# Deep Fake Detection using LSTM

## 🧠 Overview

This project focuses on detecting deep fake videos using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By analyzing sequential facial features in video frames, the model learns to identify temporal inconsistencies that are common in manipulated videos. A Flask web interface allows users to upload and test videos easily.
